/*! Flexible data container that can store any basic data type and combines hashtable and array behaviour
Anything define an easy to use data structure that comprehends built in data structures, arrays
and dictionaries (associative access aka Hashtable). It's primary use is representation of configuration
information and flexible internal datastructures like Tmp-, Role- and SessionStore.
<P>
Unless under the special circumstances described in the "memory management" section Anything
arrays display reference semantics.
<P>
<b>Multi-Threading:</b><br>Anythings are <b>not thread-safe because of the RefCounting!</b> It is therefore prohibited
to use them across thread boundaries. This implies that Anythings can only be used
within one thread. Every other use has to be read-only through ROAnything or
globally mutexed!
<P>
<b>Memory management:</b><br> To allow for scalability when used on multiprocessor machines Anything uses
its own memory management. Eventhough this is usually transparent to the user - through the use
of default parameters -  be aware that each Anything uses one specific Allocator to acquire its
memory.

Usually you will be concerned - within one thread of execution - only with Anythings that are all
using the same Allocator. Under these "default" circumstances Anything arrays will exhibit
reference semantics (this is where the story ends in most cases).
However reference semantics cannot be supported as soon as two Anythings involved in one
operation are not using the same allocator. Instead the source Anything will then be copied
transparently into the memory supplied by the Allocator of the target Anything, i.e. the target
will use a copy of the source Anything but not of a reference to the source Anything!

\note It is crucial for methods to document when they use other than the default Allocator for
returned Anythings. For documentation purposes instead of a regular Anything a TrickyThing should
be used.

/*! TrickyThing is a special Anything that is used exclusively for documentation purposes.
	Under special circumstances the memory management employed for Anythings may lead to
	non intuitive behavior which requires special attention by programmers. TrickyThing
	is used to mark these few places in the source code:

	Anything ensures that memory allocated for the implementation always is contained in
	just <B>ONE</B> memory region served by <B>ONE</B> allocator.

	Within the same allocator, Anything employs reference semantics, the usual case.
	In a simple or single threaded application there is only one memory allocator.
	A multi-threaded application might employ multiple thread-specific allocators.

	Unfortunately reference semantics for Anythings cannot be supported across allocator
	boundaries. This means an Anything allocated by one allocator will never refer to
	an Anything allocated by a different allocator. Instead the referenced Anything will
	automatically be copied into the allocator of the target Anything (you get a reference
	to a clone instead of the original reference).

	To avoid confusion about unexpected clones it is important to recognize the few places
	where Anythings with different allocators might be involved. TrickyThing will point
	you to all these places where special care is in order. In all the other places
	you can safely assume Anythings to have reference semantics.

	usage:
<pre>
	TrickyThing t(context.GetRoleStore()); // no deep copy, assume different allocator
	// work on with t like an Anything but keep reference semantics to the
	// source of it.
	Anything b = 5; // assume local allocator
	t["foo"] = b; // deep copy b to t's part
	TrickyThing tt ( t["foo"]); // keep reference semantic
	tt["baz"] = t["bar"]; // no deep copy
</pre>
