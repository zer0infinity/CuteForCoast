//! Utility functions to compare and merge anythings
/*!
\par AnyUtils::AnyCompareEqual
Compare two anythings along a complete hierarchy.
To compare two anythings, the master anything contains only the slots to be checked for, the input any may
contain more slots, but these are ignored. Any leaves are compared as strings.
Slots without names are nevertheless checked for exact matches only
If you ARE interested in the presence of a slot but not in its contents (for example if you know that the slot contents will be different),
use the string \b ignore as the slot value in the master any.
Example configuration:
\code
inputAny
{
	/Test2 { Hallo }
	/Test { Hallo }
	/Test3 "fda=dkveklrjtijijckd MON 10 Mar. 2000"
	/Test4 { { /B 4 } { /A 3 } }
}

masterAny
{
	{ Hallo }
	/Test2 { Hallo }
	/Test { Hallo }
	/Test3 ignore
	/Test4:1.A	3
}
\endcode
\note In slots without names, comparison are not shown at the leaf level but from the point at which the slotname free entries began. This is because we attempt to match slots without name by recursive comparison, and verbose is turned off during this matchmaking.

\par AnyUtils::AnyMerge
Recursively merge the content of two anythings.
There are four different merging strategies:
-# Named simple valued slot\n
If it does not exist in the master anything, the slot simply gets copied from the roaToMerge anything. Only if the slot exists and the overwrite flag is set,
the value will be overwritten.
-# Named array slot\n
If the named array does not exist it will be created. If it exists, only the non-existing parts will be inserted. You can <b>not</b> overwrite a named array from
top-level.

\note Slots get only replaced - when overwrite flag is set and value is unequal - for simple valued entries.

For unnamed slots it is a bit more sophisticated.
-# Unnamed simple valued slot\n
If the value does not yet exist it will be appended at the specified level.
-# Unnamed array slot\n
It will check all unnamed slots for the <b><i>best matching</i></b> slot which then gets merged.

Example configuration:
\code
anyMaster
{
	{
		Already
	}
	/Whatever {
		abc
	}
	{
		Here
	}
}

roaToMerge
{
	{					<-- unnamed array slot
		Here			<-- unnamed simple value
		Me
	}
	/Whatever {			<-- named array slot
		Jup
		/ASubSlot	345	<-- named simple value
	}
}

modified anyMaster
{
	{
		Already
	}
	/Whatever {
		abc
		Jup
		/ASubSlot	345
	}
	{
		Here
		Me
	}
}
\endcode
\note For more realistic examples see AnyMergeTest.any in Test/config directory
