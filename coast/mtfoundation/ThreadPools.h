//! abstract class which handles initialization, starting and termination of threads in a pool
/*!
A thread pool can be used in cases where we do not need to know what each thread does or when it does anything. Important is, that we can have an amount of parallel workers running and waiting on something to do.
<p>The thing is that we do not need an element of control which gets work from somewhere, selects a free Thread and lets it process the work. The Thread can do this on its own. Just implement a special kind of Thread which does exactly this. An excellent usage could be processing elements from a queue.

Imagine an outer Thread using WorkerPoolManager::Enter() to pass its work. Further assume that the worker just left the SetReady() method but is not yet able to check its RunningState because of a OS-ThreadSwitch. Now the caller will get active again and Thread::SetWorking() will be called to pass the workload. Now this function will get active and receive the workload to be internally stored. If the workload is an Anything which we fully need later we could store it in an Anything internally by DeepCloning the passed work. If we do this using an unmodified member-Anything and a default-param DeepClone() everything will work fine because the internal member-Anything will hav an Allocator of coast::storage::Global(). But if we try to optimize our member-Anything and call SetAllocator(fAllocator) on it - because we want unlocked fast access - we have more troubles than benefits. But why? Because in the process of DeepCloning the given ROAnything, another context-switch might occur and the WorkerThread becomes active again. As stated above, it has to check his RunningState and should process the work when it switched to eWorking. But in the call-chain there is a Mutex which - if Traces are compiled in and optionally enabled - wants to tell the console that a Mutex has to be accessed and also additional things like who it was and so on. But this String needs memory - in our case PoolAllocator memory - to hold the content to print out. Now we have the case where two concurrent accessors try to Alloc/Free PoolAllocator memory and this can lead to nice BusErrors because PoolAllocators do not use locking on internal memory accesses. */
