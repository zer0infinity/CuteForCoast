This renderer unescapes the following escape sequences until there is nothing left to unescape:\n
URL-escaping: 	\%ff and \%uffff \n
HTML-escaping:	\&\#d - \&\#dddd and \&\#xf - \&\#xffff \n

Escaped values > xFF are considered invalid (they might be potentially harmful unicode chars) and discarded.
The characters given in /BadChars are removed from the unescaped string. Under any circumstances, \%\&\<\> are removed.
This renderer may be used whenever input from a client (user) is rendered into a html page.
