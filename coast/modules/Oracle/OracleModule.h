//! Module to initialize Oracle Data Access
/*!
 * OracleModule is the module needed to initialize when wanting to access Oracle database server back ends. The
 * configuration needed is the configuration for coast::oracle::ConnectionPool which is best looked up there. Main
 * purpose of this module is to provide proper WDModule::Init and WDModule::Finis code to setup and cleanup all
 * the needed parts. In this case, initialization is delegated to coast::oracle::ConnectionPool which sets up its
 * connection pool to fulfill OracleDAImpl requests.
 * @section oms1 OracleModule configuration
