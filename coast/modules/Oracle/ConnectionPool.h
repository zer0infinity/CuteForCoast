//! Oracle specific class to handle backend connection pooling
		/*!
		 * A ConnectionPool is used to keep track of a predefined number of Connections to a back end of some type.
		 * This pool will keep track of a number of connections against Oracle database servers. It is not limited to any number of connections
		 * or servers except a possible limit exists within oracle OCI API.
		 *
		 * The pooled Connections should allow connections to any server/user combination allowed by the back end. This combination is used
		 * as key to keep the Connections in an open list for some time to reduce overhead of opening/closing connections every
		 * time a request is made.
		 * When a request is made for a connection having the same server/user combination, the previously released connection
		 * will be returned.
		 *
		 * In case there is currently no open connection for the given server/user combination, and no unused/unopened connection around,
		 * the next already opened connection will be selected (note that it has a different server/user setting), closed and returned to
		 * the caller.
		 *
		 * @section cps1 Pool configuration
		 * @see Check @ref oms1 to find out where to place the following configuration
		 *
		\code
		{
			/ParallelQueries
			/CloseConnectionTimeout
			/MemPoolSize
			/MemPoolBuckets
		}
		\endcode
		 *
		 * @par \c ParallelQueries
		 * Optional, default 5\n
		 * Long	value to define number of concurrent back end calls. The pool will pre allocate the requested number of pooled
		 * connections. The connections will not get opened unless a explicitly opened by the caller.
		 *
		 * @par \c CloseConnectionTimeout
		 * Optional, default 60\n
		 * Long	value to define time period in [s] after which to check for open connections to be closed.
		 *
		 * @par \c MemPoolSize
		 * Optional, default 2048kB\n
		 * Long value defining the size of the PoolAllocator used by the memory functions used with the connections environment
		 *
		 * @par \c MemPoolBuckets
		 * Optional, default 16\n
		 * Long value defining the number of bucket sizes to allocate inside the PoolAllocator
