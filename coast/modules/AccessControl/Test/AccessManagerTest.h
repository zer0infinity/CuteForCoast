//---- AccessManagerTest ----------------------------------------------------------
//! Test access managers with the default API.
/*!
This test can test any access manager that exports the default API.
It runs configured unit tests for the following API functions:
<i>Validate, AuthenticateWeak, AuthenticateStrong, ChangePassword,
ResetPassword, IsAllowed</i> and <i>GetAllowed</i>.
AccessManagers are defined and registered in the config of the coastd.
They have a config themselves, which in turn defines the backends
(i.e. AccessControllers) that they utilize to get access to user-
and token information.
