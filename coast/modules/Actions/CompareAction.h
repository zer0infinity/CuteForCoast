CompareAction will first check if "RenderVal"-Slots are defined. If this is
the case, the two values are rendered and compared as strings. If the
"RenderVal"-Slots are not defined, the action checks for the "LookupPath"-Slots.
If they are present, their values are rendered and then looked up. The
results are then compared as defined (by default as string).
