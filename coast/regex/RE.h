//!implement a simple regular expression engine for Coast
/*! it uses WD's memory management mechanisms with Anythings and Strings
	to make it useful for multi-threaded programs (which the standard recomp(),reexec()
	aren't). Derived from Jakarta's regular expression subproject java source
	and heavily refactored.
	the compiled regular expression is stored in an Anything
	each slot represents a node in the non-deterministic (backtracking)
	automaton. each node is a 3 slot anything with opcode, opdata (=parameter),
	and opnext, the relative offset to the next node to consider if
	the current node matches. */
