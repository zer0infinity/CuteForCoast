/*
 * Orthodox performs a simple set of tests on an arbitary
 * class to make sure that it supports at least the
 * following operations:
 *
 *		default construction	- constructor
 *		equality/inequality		- operator== && operator!=
 *		assignment				- operator=
 *		negation				- operator!
 *		safe passage			- copy construction
 *
 * If operations for each of these are not declared
 * the template will not instantiate.  If it does
 * instantiate, tests are performed to make sure
 * that the operations have correct semantics.
 *
 * Adding an orthodox test to a suite is very
 * easy:
 *
 * public: Test *suite ()  {
 *     TestSuite *suiteOfTests = new TestSuite;
 *     suiteOfTests->addTest (new ComplexNumberTest ("testAdd");
 *     suiteOfTests->addTest (new orthodox<Complex> ());
 *     return suiteOfTests;
 *  }
 *
 * Templated test cases be very useful when you are want to
 * make sure that a group of classes have the same form.
 *
 * see TestSuite
